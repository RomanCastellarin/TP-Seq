Sequences as Arr

Proofs of complexities:

emptyS and singletonS:
  W is O(1):
    fromlist is O(|x|) and x is constant, hence so is the number of operations.
  S is O(1):
    S is O(W).
    
lengthS, nthS:   
  W is O(1):
    by definition, as they are synonyms of Arr.length and Arr.!
  S is O(1):
    by definition, as they are synonyms of Arr.length and Arr.!
    
tabulateS
  W is O(sum{W(f i) : 1<=i<=n}):
    by definition, as it's a synonym of Arr.tabulate
  S is O(max{S(f i) : 1<=i<=n}):
    by definition, as it's a synonym of Arr.tabulate
 
mapS:
  it's tabulateS g |s| with g n = f (s ! n)
  W is O(sum{W(f s[i]) : 1<=i<=n}):
    W{g n} is O(W(f s[n])) (as ! is O(1) in W) 
  S is O(max{S(f s[i]) : 1<=i<=n}):
    S{g n} is O(S(f s[n])) (as ! is O(1) in S)
